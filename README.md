# 🌐 Beacon — Your Signal for Safety

**Beacon** is a mobile-first personal safety platform designed to deliver rapid emergency alerts, live location tracking, and secure evidence sharing — all coordinated through a real-time operator console.

---

## 🚨 The Problem
In moments of danger, every second counts — yet:
- Calling for help can be delayed if a phone is locked or network is weak.
- Victims may not be able to speak or clearly describe their location.
- Emergency services often lack timely, precise information to respond effectively.
- There’s no standard workflow for how operators handle panic events, leading to delays or miscommunication.

---

## ✅ The Solution — Beacon
Beacon empowers individuals to **send an emergency signal instantly** and gives operators **real-time situational awareness** to respond faster.

**Core Features (MVP)**
- **Panic Triggers:** One-tap panic button, shake-to-alert, decoy screen.
- **Background GPS:** Continuous location sharing with offline buffering.
- **Media Capture:** One-touch audio/video snippet recording (uploads when online).
- **Operator Console:** Live incident map, two-way chat/voice, SOP templates, incident logging.
- **Consent & Privacy:** User-driven data retention policies and encrypted uploads.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend (Mobile)** — React Native (cross-platform)  
**Backend API** — Django REST Framework + Django Channels (WebSockets)  
**Operator Console** — React.js Web App  
**Database** — PostgreSQL  
**Cloud Storage** — AWS S3 / GCP Storage (Signed URLs)  
**Auth** — JWT / Token-based authentication  
**Monitoring** — Sentry for crash/error reporting

## 📍 Project Workflow

**1. User Side (Mobile App)**
- User triggers alert via panic button, shake, or decoy screen.
- App captures GPS + optional audio/video snippet.
- If offline, stores data locally and uploads when connected.

**2. Backend**
- Receives alert and stores securely with timestamps, location, and media links.
- Pushes event to operator console in real-time via WebSockets.
- Applies consent-based retention rules.

**3. Operator Console**
- Displays active events on a live map.
- Enables two-way chat or push-to-talk with user.
- Logs actions taken and applies predefined SOP templates.
- Marks incident as resolved when closed.
