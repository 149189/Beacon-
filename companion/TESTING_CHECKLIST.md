## Flutter WebSocket Testing

### Phase 1: Basic Connection Test

#### Step 1: Navigate to WebSocket Test
- [ ] Open Flutter app
- [ ] Look for debug FAB (orange bug icon) OR navigate to `/websocket-test`
- [ ] Tap "WebSocket Test" from debug menu

#### Step 2: Initial State Check
- [ ] Screen shows "Status: DISCONNECTED"
- [ ] Connection indicator is grey
- [ ] Message log shows "No messages yet"

#### Step 3: Authentication Check
- [ ] Tap "Check Auth Status" in debug menu
- [ ] Verify user is logged in
- [ ] If not logged in, complete login first

### Phase 2: Connection Testing

#### Step 4: Establish WebSocket Connection
- [ ] Tap "Connect" button
- [ ] Watch connection status change to "CONNECTING" (orange)
- [ ] Wait for status to change to "CONNECTED" (green)

**Expected Log Messages:**
```
14:30:45: WebSocket test initialized
14:30:46: Connection state: connecting
14:30:47: WebSocket connection initiated
14:30:48: Connection state: connected
14:30:48: WebSocket: User channel connected
```

#### Step 5: Verify Heartbeat
- [ ] Wait 30 seconds
- [ ] Should see periodic heartbeat messages in backend logs
- [ ] Connection should remain stable

### Phase 3: Alert Testing

#### Step 6: Create Test Alert
- [ ] Tap "Create Alert" button
- [ ] Check for success message in log

**Expected Log Messages:**
```
14:31:00: Test alert created: alert_123
14:31:01: WebSocket: Connected to alert channel: alert_123
```

#### Step 7: Location Tracking
- [ ] After alert creation, location updates should start automatically
- [ ] Look for location update messages every 30 seconds

**Expected Log Messages:**
```
14:31:15: WebSocket: Location update sent
14:31:30: WebSocket: Location update sent
14:31:45: WebSocket: Location update sent
```

### Phase 4: Real-time Updates Testing

#### Step 8: Backend Status Change Test
- [ ] Open Django admin in browser
- [ ] Navigate to the created alert
- [ ] Change status from "active" to "acknowledged"
- [ ] Check mobile app for real-time update

**Expected Log Messages:**
```
14:32:00: Alert Update: {type: alert_status_update, status: acknowledged, alert_id: alert_123}
14:32:01: Alert status updated: acknowledged
```

#### Step 9: Operator Message Test
- [ ] In Django admin, send an operator message
- [ ] Check mobile app for incoming message

**Expected Log Messages:**
```
14:32:15: Operator: Emergency services have been notified
```

### Phase 5: Chat Testing

#### Step 10: Send Message from Mobile
- [ ] Enter text in message input field
- [ ] Tap "Send" button
- [ ] Verify message appears in log

**Expected Log Messages:**
```
14:32:30: Sent: Help needed at my location
14:32:30: WebSocket: Chat message sent: Help needed at my location
```

#### Step 11: Receive Message from Backend
- [ ] Use Django admin or API to send chat response
- [ ] Check mobile app receives message

**Expected Log Messages:**
```
14:32:45: Chat: Can you provide more details about your situation?
```

### Phase 6: Alert Management

#### Step 12: Cancel Alert via WebSocket
- [ ] Tap "Cancel Alert" button
- [ ] Verify alert cancellation

**Expected Log Messages:**
```
14:33:00: WebSocket: Cancel request sent via WebSocket
14:33:01: Alert status updated: canceled
14:33:02: Alert cancellation requested
```

#### Step 13: Location Tracking Stops
- [ ] After alert cancellation, location updates should stop
- [ ] No more location update messages should appear

### Phase 7: Connection Resilience

#### Step 14: Disconnection Test
- [ ] Tap "Disconnect" button
- [ ] Verify status changes to "DISCONNECTED"
- [ ] Connection indicator turns grey

#### Step 15: Reconnection Test
- [ ] Tap "Connect" again
- [ ] Verify automatic reconnection works
- [ ] Status should return to "CONNECTED"

#### Step 16: Network Interruption Test (Advanced)
- [ ] While connected, turn off WiFi/mobile data
- [ ] Watch connection status change to "ERROR" or "RECONNECTING"
- [ ] Turn network back on
- [ ] Verify automatic reconnection occurs

## Common Issues & Solutions

### üö® Connection Fails
**Symptoms:** Status stays "DISCONNECTED" or shows "ERROR"
**Solutions:**
1. Check backend server is running
2. Verify WebSocket endpoints are accessible
3. Check authentication token is valid
4. Confirm network connectivity

### üö® No Real-time Updates
**Symptoms:** Messages sent but not received
**Solutions:**
1. Verify WebSocket consumers are running
2. Check Django Channels configuration
3. Confirm Redis is running (if used)
4. Test with backend WebSocket client first

### üö® Authentication Errors
**Symptoms:** "User not logged in" errors
**Solutions:**
1. Complete login process first
2. Check token hasn't expired
3. Verify AuthService is initialized
4. Test with debug auth status check

### üö® Location Updates Not Working
**Symptoms:** No location messages in log
**Solutions:**
1. Check location permissions granted
2. Verify GPS is enabled
3. Ensure alert is active
4. Check LocationService initialization
